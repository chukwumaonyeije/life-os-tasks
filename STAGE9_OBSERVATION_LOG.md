# Stage 9: In the Wild Observation Log

**Purpose**: Record reality, not expectations. Trust is calibrated through observation, not assumption.

**Duration**: 14-30 days minimum  
**Started**: [DATE]  
**Status**: NOT STARTED (awaiting deployment)

---

## Instructions

### What to Record

Write **brief, unfiltered observations** after each interaction. No analysis yet.

**Good entries**:
- "Approved immediately without reading rationale"
- "Confidence score felt reassuring"
- "Ignored AI suggestion, used manual instead"
- "Rationale was too verbose"

**Bad entries**:
- "System worked well" (too vague)
- "AI should be improved by..." (premature optimization)
- Long paragraphs (just note, don't analyze)

### When to Record

- After approving a suggestion
- After rejecting a suggestion
- When something feels off
- When something delights
- When you ignore the system entirely

### What You're Looking For

1. **Where AI suggestions help**
2. **Where they annoy**
3. **Where they are ignored**
4. **Where rationales matter**
5. **Where trust subtly shifts**

**Do not correct anything during this period. Just observe.**

## Next Actions

Based on observations, which path?

- [ ] **Stage 10 is valuable** → Proceed with implementation
- [ ] **Stage 10 should be narrower** → Revise scope
- [ ] **Stage 10 should wait** → Pause indefinitely
- [ ] **Stage 9 needs revision** → Fix issues first

**Reasoning**:
- 

**Blocking issues** (if any):
- 

**Green lights** (if any):
